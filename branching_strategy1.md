# Trunk-Based Branching Strategy: Release Flow

## Idee

* Release Flow als Vereinfachung gegenÃ¼ber GitFlow.
* "Standing on the shoulders of giants": Microsoft, Google, Facebook...
* Exzellent dokumentiert.

**Aber Vorsicht: Das ist noch *nicht* der Release Flow!**  
> Port your changes from your release branch into a new feature branch to bring them back into the master branch.
> Use cherry-picking instead of merging so that you have exact control over which commits are ported back to the master branch.
> Merging the feature branch into the master branch can bring over release-specific changes you don't want in the master branch.
>
> Release branches [...] coordinate and stabilize changes in a release of your code.
> This branch is long-lived and isn't merged back into the master branch in a pull request, unlike the feature branches.

**Das ist der Release Flow!**  
> Release Flow lets us [...] work from short-lived topic branches.
> When we're ready to ship, [...] we start a new release branch off master.
> Release branches never merge back to master, so we require cherry-picking important changes.
> [Hotfixes:] once we have merged the pull request into master, we cherry-pick the change into the release branch.

**Feature Flags**  
Vermeiden lang laufende Feature Branches, die ein Alptraum zum Mergen sind!  
> Azure DevOps merges the code to master, and it'll deploy in the next sprint or TFS release.
> Importantly, that doesn't mean the new feature will show up right away.
> We've talked elsewhere about how we decouple deployment and exposure of new features using feature flags.
> This means even if the feature needs a little more bake time before it's ready to show off, if the product builds and deploys, it's safe to go to master.
> Once in master, the code ends up in an official build, where it's (again) tested, confirmed to meet policy, and digitally signed.
